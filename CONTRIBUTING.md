# Contributing

This document outlines everything to know about contributing for liskvork.

Contributions are always welcome, there is no CLA (the code you contribute will
always be yours whatever happens).

## Overall conduct

tldr; Don't be a dick

Don't forget that everyone here is a human person that deserves to be treated as
such. So be patient, have some empathy, and don't intentionally antagonize
anyone.

Everyone is different, no one thinks the exact same, so have some decency while
discussing. Intolerance will be met with intolerance towards you (yes that
is the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance),
I don't care).

If you don't like this conduct guideline then you have a few solutions:
1. Don't contribute to this project
2. Mald about it, then don't contribute to this project
3. Send an email to ireallydontliketheseguidelines@kreog.com with your
    complaints (I will 100% read them, trust me)
4. Be a normal person and open an issue about it (Be civil of course, else I
    will just be closing it instantly without warning)

## AI/LLM usage

tldr; No LLM usage allowed for contributions

Generative AI was a mistake (at least in its current state), and that is a hill
I will die on.

Until generative AI:
1. Is 100% opt-in
2. Gives credits to all contributing sources
3. Doesn't break license agreements (Copyleft license such as the GPL suffer a
    lot from this currently)
4. [Doesn't need the electricity consumption of a small country to function
    properly](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863)
5. Stops hallucinating

Then AI/LLM related technologies will be completely unwelcome into this project.

LLM written text/code waste not only precious resources (electricity and such),
but also a lot of time from maintainers and contributors.

If you don't like this restriction then feel free to fork this project. (Don't
forget to respect the license, because I know that some of you will absolutely
"forget" to do so...)

**Do not open an issue about this**, I will close it directly as this is not
something I want to argue/waste my time with.
